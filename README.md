# Pabbly Connect UI Customization Project
This is a small project intended to improve the UI/UX of [Pabbly Connect](https://payments.pabbly.com/api/affurl/RVYZ07kQyUZ0Z1HUKZ1m/A560XKyFWWsZ23ito?target=nMfdbf0I90K3UdJn) â€” an excellent no-code automation platform.
For the time being, I will only provide CSS rules, and in order to apply those, users will need to install the [User JavaSCript and CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) extension for Chrome/Edge or a similar add-on for Firefox like [Stulys](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
If I see viability in this project, I may release a standalone extension that does injection by itself.
